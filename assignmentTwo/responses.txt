A directory is the same concept as a folder, but it should used especially when discussing file systems. Directories hold files in an organized folder.
VCS are useful because they allow you to see past versions of your directory in case something breaks or you like an older version better. 
My favorite artistic medium is paint because it is fun to work with.
