I visited https://www.coolmathgames.com. It was from November 15, 2006. The older version is greatly different from the newer one in terms of overall design in that it is set up with the different game type links on the left side, instead of using drop-downs. There is also a "related searches" area at the bottom that is not found on the current website. There is a common theme with font and colors, but it is very simple and not as visually appealing as the current version. There are also options for tutoring and such on the old website.
