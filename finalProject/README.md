How did your user testing sessions go?
My user testing sessions didn't go very well. Mostly because I still have some work to do in regard to making links work and adding in pictures I have been gathering. 
What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I have not had a chance to make changes yet.
